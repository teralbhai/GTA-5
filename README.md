GTA 5 Key Code is an action-packed game that follows the thrilling adventures of three robbers in the vast city of Los Santos (based on real-life Los Angeles) and its surrounding areas, including the picturesque Blaine County, filled with forests, lakes, and deserts. The major difference in GTA 5 compared to other games in the series is the presence of three main protagonists. Each character has a unique skill that can be used in critical situations, and you can switch between them almost anytime during gameplay.
